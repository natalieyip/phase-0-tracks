# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that ables you to track, review, and modify changes made to a code while creating a back up. It's useful because it allows us to see where and when all changes were made even if they were made by different people. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplicate of the original code where it enables you to made modifications without changing the original. You would want to use a branch because it allows for peer review as well as enabling you to work simultaneously with your team members as they would build new branches to an original project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saved point in Git. A good commit message is concise and includes details to the changes you last made. 

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict is when clashing changes happens to the same code. It generally occurs if two people make different changes to the same line of the same file or if someone edits a file and another individual deletes that same file.
